(use your atlas, patricia!). this sauce is ideally used with large shrimps caught in the open sea -- not the sickly, tastless ""farmed"" shrimps. it is served heaped on a plate, with rice. you can peel it yourself, but the heads can safely be crunched ... usually, if ordered, they ask you whether you want ""hot"", ""medium"", ""mild"", or with lemon butter. the lemon butter is for nerds, naturally, lol!! you can use the entire recipe to throw in the pan and fry the prawns in, or as i do, skim off oil from the sauce mixture and fry the prawns in that, and then serve the rest of the sauce as a dipping sauce. damp cloths and bowls for peels needed ... !

Easter Hard Boiled Eggs,354371,12,1119236,2009-02-06,9.0,"a gruszecki tradition and now ours, is that each person gets a colored egg at the beginning of the meal, right after ""grace"". each person uses his/her egg to tap on everyone else at the table, while wishing them a happy easter. part of the trick is to be the last one with an egg not crushed. after you smack eggs with everyone at the table, the egg gets peeled and eaten.

the following are a few hints that will help you cook the best hardboiled eggs:

the fresher the egg, the harder it will be to peal it. you should purchase your eggs 2 weeks before you'll be cooking them in order to get them to peal easy.

and, the way to get the yolk to be in the center of the egg after it's boiled, is to store them on their side. this relieves the pressure on the membrane within the egg that holds it suspended.

the green coloring on the outside of the yolk is caused by cooking them too long. cooking by the directions below will eliminate that.

B 52,58495,5,58104,2003-04-07,6.0,"i made this delish b-52 cake by leta and wondered why it was called that! i found out their is a drink by that name so i posted it for you all to enjoy. if you want to layer for an alternate method instead of on the rock try, the secret to making the perfect layered drink is to pour your heaviest liqueur first, then add other liqueurs according to their density. this way the alcohol will not mix, but layer, one on top of the other. to figure the density of different liqueurs you may have to experiment a bit, but generally syrupy schnapps type liqueurs are the most dense, then cream liqueurs such as irish cream, and lastly regular liqueurs such as gin or vodka. 
to actually pour these drinks, the secret is to pour very slowly, barely dribble the liqueurs into your glass. start with your first liqueur and pour it into your glass, now take your spoon and place the tip of the spoon very close to your first liqueur, now carefully and slowly pour in your second liqueur over the back of the spoon and into the glass, then your third. repeat this step as many times as necessary to complete your drink. after a little practice you can generally do away with the spoon and will be able to pour a slow steady stream, and keep your liqueurs from mixing.",4.0,1258,2,2003
